# Process management in Linux

## `top`

The `top` program provides a dynamic real-time view of a running system.

Usually `top` is used with the option `-c`.

```
top -c
```

The option `-c` will let `top` to displat the full command path along with the command arguments in the `COMMAND` collumn. 

You can also run `top` interactively. You can run `top` first and then press `c`. If you want to kill a process with `PID` of `186`, you can press `k` and then type `186` to kill the process with `PID` of 186.  

`man top` can help you get the manual of command `top`. 

The following table explains what each column mean.

## `ps`

The command `ps` can report a snapshot of the current processes. 

Command `ps` is usually used with the option `-a`, `-u` and `-x`.

```
ps -aux   ## can also be `ps aux`
```

You can pipe the output to `less` to make it scrollable.

## `kill`

If you want to kill a process, you can use the command `kill`. 

```
kill 20140418
```

## `df`

`df` can be used to report file system disk space usage. 

```{sh}
df -h 
```

If you Linux cluster, you might need to check other command like `myquota`. 

## Advanced topic `free`

You can use command `free` to display amount of free and used memory in the system. 

```
free -h
```

`-h` let you show all output fields automatically scaled  to  shortest  three  digit unit and display the units of print out.  Following units are used.
